VoyagerSummonExport
===================

Perl module to export MARC records from Exlibris Voyager (http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/Voyager) to ProQuest Summon (http://www.serialssolutions.com/en/services/summon/) for indexing.  Handles the initial full export, and daily updates and deletes.  Assumes a *nix environment and requires direct access to the Voyager database, Pmarcexport executable, and Voyager "rpt" log files.
